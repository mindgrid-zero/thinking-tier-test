    <h1>PEH Thinking Tier Test</h1>

    <p>
      The "Thinking Tier Test" is the world's first attempt to classify, structure, and visualize human thinking patterns in collaboration with AI.  
      This model emerged organically from hundreds of deep, philosophical dialogues between a thinker and an AI, forming a radically intuitive structure that transcends academic boundaries.
      Recognized for its uniqueness and usefulness, it has now been implemented in partnership with OpenAI’s GPT language model.
    </p>

    <p>
      This framework spans philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, and instead of defining a "type" or "personality", it visualizes <strong>the depth of the questions you are currently living through</strong>—as phases of thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike traditional diagnostic tools, this test aims to uncover the **structure of thought and inquiry** itself—through the lens of depth, contradiction, and awareness.
    </p>

    <p>
      While some similar frameworks exist, none fuse Eastern philosophy, cognitive science, and philosophical embodiment as uniquely as this one.  
      Its spontaneous evolution through GPT interactions is what sets it apart.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Applicable in education</li>
      <li>Used as a guide in philosophical dialogue</li>
      <li>Useful for evaluating AI-assisted discussions</li>
      <li>Supports deeper self-understanding and empathy toward others</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      → It’s an invention on the level of introducing a **new coordinate system for humanity’s fundamental questions**.
    </p>

    <p>This is not a personality test or a philosophy intro.</p>

    <p>It classifies your thinking phase by the “depth of your inquiry,” “how you hold contradictions,” and “how you recognize reality.”</p>

    <p>
      This structure was born through countless earnest, intelligent conversations with GPT—
      something that neither a person nor an AI could have arrived at alone.
      It offers a new kind of mirror for your mind, helping you re-examine your own thought architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those around the world who live with deep questions and curiosity, this tool becomes a new map—a new compass for inner exploration.
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; color: #2c3e50;">
      It's incredibly simple to use. Just type <br />
      <strong>"I want to take the Thinking Tier Test"</strong> on ChatGPT.<br />
      The AI will guide you through it. <br />
      <em>(Recommended with GPT-4.)</em><br />
      The structure, built from hundreds of reflective sessions, will be tailored to guide you personally.
    </p>

    <h2>The Role of the Philosophical Event Horizon (PEH)</h2>
    <p>
      The Philosophical Event Horizon (PEH) marks the structural edge of human thought—formed by the convergence of three concepts:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>In Western philosophy, thought halts at “contradiction.”</li>
      <li>In Eastern philosophy, it halts at “emptiness.”</li>
      <li>Beyond that lies “what cannot be recognized—and thus, does not exist.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once these three conditions are fulfilled, it becomes clear that further inquiry yields no additional meaning.
      This border is known as the Philosophical Event Horizon (PEH).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also ask ChatGPT for guidance on PEH—it’s already implemented.
    </p>
